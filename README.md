# Code-a-pookkalam
Hi all, My name os Manika Elizabeth Roy and I'm studying in S5 CSE.
This is the overview of the pookkalam I have generated in mon.school using python.



This program creates a series of geometric shapes (rectangles, circles, ellipses) with custom colors and rotations to form visually appealing patterns. Each shape is filled with a unique color and repeated at different angles for dynamic designs.

### Shapes and Colors:
1. **Burgundy Rectangle**: Rotated 50 times at 15 degrees.
2. **Peach Circle**: Radius 100.
3. **Lemon Yellow Rectangle**: Rotated 30 times at 30 degrees.
4. **Dark Green Ellipse**: Rotated 20 times at 40 degrees.
5. **Red Ellipse**: Rotated 30 times at 45 degrees.
6. **Crimson Circle**: Radius 65.
7. **Navy Ellipse**: Rotated 50 times at 40 degrees.
8. **White Circle**: Radius 55.
9. **Purple Ellipse**: Rotated 20 times at 40 degrees.
10. **Dark Red Rectangle**: Rotated 30 times at 50 degrees.
11. **Orange Ellipse Outline**: Rotated 60 times at 45 degrees.

Each shape adds a unique element to the overall design using various rotations and color combinations.
